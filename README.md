# EPRpy


## About

EPRPy is a python library to streamline handling, inspection and processing of Electron Paramagnetic resonance data.
The library is born out of a collection of scripts I wrote for routine analysis of EPR data and simple presentation of results  during my doctoral work. EPRPy might be of use to you if you want to quickly read, plot and export EPR data acquired on Bruker EPR spectrometers.  EPRPy focusses on ease of use, generating quick plots for data inspection and features automated processing workflows for specific EPR experiments.

## Installation

Clone or download this repositiory and then navigate the folder where setup.py file is present.
Then, type in a terminal :

`python -m pip install .`

## Features

* Read and export EPR data.
* Basic processing capabilities such as interactive baseline correction, integration etc.
* Generate quikc plots of 1D and 2D datasets, compare different datasets etc.
* Automated processing workflows 

## Limitations
* Supports reading of files only in Bruker BES3T format v.1.2.
