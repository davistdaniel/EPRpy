# EPRpy


## About

EPRPy is a python library to streamline handling, inspection and processing of Electron Paramagnetic resonance data.
The library is born out of a collection of scripts I wrote for routine analysis of EPR data and simple presentation of results during my doctoral work. EPRPy might be of use to you if you want to quickly read, plot and export EPR data acquired on Bruker EPR spectrometers.  EPRPy focusses on ease of use, generating quick plots for data inspection and processing workflows for specific EPR experiments.
